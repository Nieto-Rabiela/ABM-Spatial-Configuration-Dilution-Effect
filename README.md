The Excel file named "Supplementary Material" consists of four sheets:

"Kind of Movements": This sheet contains the maximum prevalence values from simulations 1 to 1000, divided into five tested movement types:

Home Range: Circular movement.
Small World: Linear movement.
Mix A: Vector follows circular movement, while the host moves randomly.
Mix B: Host follows circular movement, while the vector moves randomly.
Random: Both vector and host move randomly.
Additionally, it records the number of patches agents move through (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50).

"Density": This sheet shows the results of the maximum prevalence obtained in each of the 1000 simulations for different density levels. It includes a "Density" column and the distance in patches that agents moved, ranging from 1 to 10.

Third Sheet: Similar to the "Density" sheet, but it includes diversity among vectors.

Fourth Sheet: Also similar to the "Density" sheet, but it includes diversity among hosts.
