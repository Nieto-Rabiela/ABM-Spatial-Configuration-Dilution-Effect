The "Supplementary Material" Excel file includes the following four sheets:

Kind of Movements: This sheet organizes the maximum prevalence values obtained from simulations 1 to 1000 into five tested movement types.

Home Range: Circular movement.
Small World: Linear movement.
Mix A: The vector follows a circular movement while the host moves randomly.
Mix B: The host follows a circular movement while the vector moves randomly.
Random: Both the vector and host move randomly.
Additionally, it records the number of patches that agents move through, with values of 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50.

Density: This sheet displays the maximum prevalence results obtained in each 1000 simulations, varying by density levels. It includes a "Density" column and the distance in patches that agents moved, ranging from 1 to 10.

Vector Diversity: This sheet is similar to the "Density" sheet but includes diversity among vectors.

Host Diversity: Similar to the "Density" sheet, this one focuses on the diversity among hosts.
